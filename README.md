# Key Insights

* Age & Device-Based Behavior *  
  The data captures user demographics such as age group and device type, revealing how UPI adoption varies across different segments. Younger users are typically more active on mobile platforms, while older groups show more varied engagement.

* Transaction Flow by Institution *
  Fields like Bank Name Sent and Bank Name Received show inter-bank UPI traffic, highlighting top contributing banks and helping to identify usage concentration.

* Geographic Trends * 
  The city-level breakdown allows mapping of UPI usage across urban and rural regions. The map visualization reveals key transaction hubs and opportunities for expansion in less-served locations.

* Merchant Insights * 
  With fields like Merchant Name and Merchant Account Number, the dashboard identifies top vendors and sectors driving UPI transactions, offering insight into consumer spending behavior.

* Transaction Types & Methods * 
  The dashboard segments data by transaction type, payment method, and payment mode to distinguish peer-to-peer vs. merchant transactions and app-based vs. QR-based payments.

* Time Series Trends *  
  Using Transaction Date, the visualizations track UPI growth over time, uncovering seasonal spikes and consistent upward trends in both value and volume.

* Performance Indicators *  
  Card visuals summarize KPIs, including:
  - Total number of transactions  
  - Total transaction value  
  - Average transaction size  
  - Peak transaction periods
